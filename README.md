# README

This is intended for personal use only. Security and safety are both an afterthought. It should not be used for any commercial or public use, ever. If you aren't me, you probably shouldn't touch this code. Even I probably shouldn't touch it.

There is no LICENSE in this repo on purpose. The code is visible source, not open source, and is only for fun.
